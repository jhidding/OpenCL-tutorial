# The premeson.sh script generated meson build files in the source directories
# one level deep. These directories are scanned for .cc files, and collected
# in a Meson `files` object, all these directories are visited in the build
# file that is present in `src`.
#
# If the directory name contains any hyphen, it is replaced with an underscore,
# and the entire name gets the `_files` suffix.
#
# This means all .cc files in for example the `src/cl-util` folder are included
# using `cl_util_files`.
